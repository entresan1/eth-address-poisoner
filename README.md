## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning: Use Responsibly & Ethically! ‚ö†Ô∏è

This tool is designed **strictly for educational purposes and authorized security research**. ETH Address Poisoning is a deceptive technique that can cause significant financial loss if used maliciously.

*   üõë **DO NOT** use this tool against any individual or entity without their explicit, written permission.
*   ‚öñÔ∏è Unauthorized use is **illegal and unethical**. You are solely responsible for your actions.
*   üõ°Ô∏è The primary goal is to **understand the attack vector** to build better defenses and raise user awareness.
*   üéì Use this tool to learn, test your own security assumptions (on testnets or with owned addresses), or during authorized penetration testing engagements.

**The developers assume NO liability and are NOT responsible for any misuse or damage caused by this tool.**

## ü§î What is ETH Address Poisoning?

ETH Address Poisoning is a social engineering attack targeting cryptocurrency users. It exploits the common habit of users copying addresses from their transaction history rather than verifying them fully each time.

**Here's the attack flow:**

1.  **Target Identification:** The attacker identifies a target address (Victim).
2.  **Vanity Address Generation:** The attacker generates a large number of Ethereum addresses (`AttackerVanityAddr`) that visually mimic the Victim's address (or an address the Victim frequently interacts with). Usually, the first few and last few characters match (e.g., `0x1234...abcd`).
3.  **The "Poison" Transaction:** The attacker sends a tiny (often zero-value) amount of ETH or a token *from* their `AttackerVanityAddr` *to* the Victim's address.
4.  **The Trap:** This transaction now appears in the Victim's wallet history. The `AttackerVanityAddr` looks very similar to an address the Victim trusts or uses often.
5.  **The Mistake:** Later, when the Victim intends to send a *significant* amount of funds to their intended recipient, they might quickly glance at their history, see the familiar-looking `AttackerVanityAddr`, copy it, and paste it into the recipient field without careful verification.
6.  **Funds Lost:** The Victim unknowingly sends their funds to the attacker's vanity address instead of the legitimate recipient.

**Why it's effective:**

*   **User Habit:** Relies on the shortcut of copy-pasting from history.
*   **Visual Deception:** Long hexadecimal addresses are hard to compare character-by-character. Matching start/end characters often provide a false sense of security.
*   **Wallet UI:** Some wallets truncate addresses in the UI, making the similar parts more prominent.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How EtherEcho Works

`EtherEcho` automates the crucial steps of an address poisoning *simulation* for security testing:

1.  **üéØ Input:** You provide the target address you want to simulate the attack against (e.g., an address you own on a testnet for research). Optionally, you can provide addresses the target frequently interacts with (counterparties) to generate even more deceptive vanity addresses.
2.  **üîë Vanity Address Generation:** `EtherEcho` utilizes efficient algorithms [Mention specific method if applicable, e.g., multi-threaded CPU or GPU generation] to generate vanity addresses that match the first `N` and last `M` characters of the target address *or* its counterparties.
3.  **üí∏ Transaction Crafting:** It connects to an Ethereum node (via RPC URL) using a provided private key (which needs a small amount of ETH for gas).
4.  **‚ò£Ô∏è Poisoning Simulation:** For each generated vanity address, it sends a minimal (configurable, near-zero) value ETH transaction *from* the vanity address *to* the target address. This populates the target's transaction history with these look-alike addresses.
5.  **üìä Logging & Output:** Provides clear logs of generated addresses, transaction hashes, and success/failure status.

üöÄ Key Features: Why EtherEcho Stands Out

‚ú® High-Performance Generation: Optimized vanity address generation [mention specifics like 'multi-core support' or 'GPU acceleration via XYZ' if true]. Find matching addresses faster.

üéØ Advanced Targeting: Poison based on the target or their frequent counterparties for more realistic simulation scenarios.

üîß Highly Configurable:

Set custom prefix/suffix lengths for vanity addresses.

Adjust the tiny ETH value sent in poisoning transactions.

Configure gas price/limit settings.

Specify custom RPC endpoints (Mainnet, Testnets, Local).

üåê Network Flexibility: Works with any EVM-compatible chain via RPC (Ethereum Mainnet, Goerli, Sepolia, Polygon, BSC, etc.).

üîê Security Focused: Designed for researchers and blue teams to understand and test defenses. Does not store private keys persistently [Verify this is true for your tool].

üìà Clear Logging: Verbose output detailing the process, generated addresses, and transaction hashes for analysis.

üêç Clean Python Codebase: Easy to understand, modify, and contribute to.

Bash

Configuration:

Copy the example configuration file: cp config.example.yaml config.yaml

Edit config.yaml with your details:

rpc_url: Your Ethereum node RPC endpoint (e.g., Infura, Alchemy, or a local node).

private_key: !! DANGER !! The private key of the source wallet used to fund the temporary vanity addresses and pay for gas. Use a dedicated burner wallet with minimal funds ONLY for testing/research. Consider using environment variables for better security (see below).

value_to_send_ether: The tiny amount of ETH to send in each poisoning transaction (e.g., "0.00001").

Security Best Practice: Avoid storing private keys directly in config files. Use environment variables:

export ETHERECHO_PRIVATE_KEY="0xYourPrivateKeyHere"
export ETHERECHO_RPC_URL="https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_ID"
# Then modify the script to read from os.environ

üí° Usage

Explanation:

--target TARGET_ADDRESS: The ETH address to simulate poisoning against (e.g., 0xAb5801a7D398351b8bE11C439e05C5B3259aeC9B).

--prefix N: Match the first N characters (after 0x).

--suffix M: Match the last M characters.

--count C: Generate C different vanity addresses and send transactions.

Targeting Counterparties:

python etherecho.py --target 0xVictimAddress \
                    --counterparties 0xCounterParty1 0xCounterParty2 \
                    --prefix 6 --suffix 5 --count 20 \
